# A place for various Spring Boot use cases

The idea is to have ready to use examples which can be easily incorporated into your project.

This is a way to give back to OSS community which inspires me and helps me to be better professionalist.

## Structure

This is a mono repo with multiple modules which cover single use case.

## Target

Main target is latest version of Spring Boot, covering both MVC and WebFlux.
